My idea for a Route planner with intervals, based on data from openstreetmap.org 

A example: say I have plan a roadtrip that has the total length of 692.8 km, 12 h 0Â  min on a web page. I want to drive 3-4 hours per day.

Map example:
https://routing.openstreetmap.de/?z=12&center=61.191747%2C7.260590&loc=61.263212%2C12.825336&loc=61.184197%2C7.244966&loc=62.471141%2C6.155176&hl=en&alt=0&srv=0 

The map tool then splits the total length in 3-4 hours intervals, and searces for suitable places to park over the night using the openstreetmap api. 
Then it displays those on the map, with possibility to write to gpx files.

The relevant openstreet tags can be found here for official rest places.

More unofficial can look like this, a parking lot with a toilet nearby.

Even more unofficial:
Camping in Norway has these rules, if Camping along roads that has gravel surface and little traffic is OK if:
Minimum 100 meters away from houses, don't litter or block the road.
Tags for such a road might look like this example:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/273239448#map=14/61.89398/10.86351
https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/273940924#map=16/61.88433/10.73965

Information about the api, it has a python wrapper among other things.
